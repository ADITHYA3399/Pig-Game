### Rules: <br />
An Android dice game. In this a player will win when his actual score is greater than or equal to 100. When a player roll a die, the score will be added to his current score. It is not yet freezed(or added to actual score) until you click on **HOLD** button(bag symbol). If you didn't press hold button until you got 6 on dice then the whole current score will get 0. So, here 6 is the villan of the game. A new game will be started when you click on **NEW GAME** button(referesh symbol). <br /><br />
